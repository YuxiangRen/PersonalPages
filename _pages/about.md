Currently, I'm a 2nd year Ph.D. student in [IFM Lab](http://www.ifmlab.org/) at Florida State University, advised by [Dr. Jiawei Zhang](http://www.ifmlab.org/). Prior to joining FSU, I received M.S. in Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute and B.Eng. in Software Engineering and L.L.B in Law from Nanjing University.
My research interests lie in the fields of data mining and machine learning. In particular, I focus on the development and analysis of algorithms for brain, social and information networks, as well as modeling feature interactions [slides] and broad learning for healthcare [slides].
​

My research lies in the intersection of Data Mining, Machine Learning and Social Science, with an emphasis on Social Media Mining, Computational Social Science and Journalism. Recently, I'm working on Fake News Detection and Intervention.
